Message Logger
===============

Message Logger was initially developed for internal use at Inigral Inc. to easily monitor log messages from a large quanity of applications.

Credit goes to Exception Logger for providing an excellent example of how to create plugins such as this one.

To use this plugin you will need to run the following migration:

    create_table :logged_messages, :force => true do |t|
      t.string :title, :source
      t.text :description
      t.integer :severity
      t.timestamps
    end

Then add the following route to routes.rb:

  map.resources :logged_messages
