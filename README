Message Logger
===============

Message Logger was initially developed for internal use at Inigral Inc. to easily monitor log messages from a large quanity of applications.

Credit goes to Exception Logger for providing an excellent example of how to create plugins such as this one.

To install:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/inigral/RSS-Message-Logger.git

To use this plugin you will need to run the following migration:

    create_table :logged_messages, :force => true do |t|
      t.string :title, :source
      t.text :description
      t.integer :severity
      t.timestamps
    end

Then add the following route to routes.rb:

  map.resources :logged_messages

The RSS feed of your logs will be available at:

    yourdomain.com/logged_messages/
